* Notes:
  1. what really matters in this section - 5min
  2. An Introduction To Merging - 5min
     1. combine changes from two branches (merge branches, not commits)
     2. two steps:
        1. switch to receiving branch: ex: `git checkout master`
        2. merge from other branch into receiving branch: ex: `git merge feature`
  3. Performing A Fast Forward Merge - 5min
     1. situation: Just one branch (feature) have additional commits:
        `git merge feature`  -- simply move the pointer of the branch (master) to the other branch (feature)
     2. show it graphically

        - before merge: master is active branch: `git checkout master`
          m1 -- m2 (HEAD -> master)
                \
                f1 -- f2 (feature)

        - after merge: `git merge feature`  # master pointer fast forward to feature
          m1 -- m2
                  \
                  f1 -- f2 (HEAD -> master, feature)

  4. Visualizing Merges - 5min
     1. `git log --oneline --graph --all`
     2. show it graphically in vscode
  5. Generating Merge Commits without conflict - 10min
     1. situation: Both branches (master and feature) have additional commits:
        `git merge feature`  -- git automatically generate new commit (merge-commit) if there is NO conflict.
     2. show it graphically

        - before merge: master is active branch: `git checkout master`
          m1 -- m2 -- m3 (HEAD -> master)
                \
                f1 -- f2 (feature)

        - after merge: `git merge feature`
          - New merge-commit will be automatically generated by git, for master to point to
          - The new merge-commit has two parents: master (m3) and feature (f2)
          m1 -- m2 -- m3 -- merge-commit (HEAD -> master)
                  \       /
                  f1 -- f2 (feature)
  6. Merge with Conflicts and resolve it
  7. Resolving Merge Conflicts - 8min
     1. situation: Both branches (master and feature) have additional commits and there is conflict:
        `git merge feature`  -- git will NOT automatically generate new commit (merge-commit) if there is conflict. Get following message:
          `CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt`
          `Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.`
     2. `git status` to see the conflict files
     3. open the conflict file and resolve it. Remove the conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
     4. `git status` to see if the conflict files are resolved
     5. `git add file.txt` to mark the conflict as resolved
     6. `git commit -m "merge conflict resolved"` to create a new merge-commit
  8. Using VSCode To Resolve Conflicts - 8min
     1. your vscode to open the conflict file
     2. vscode will show the conflict markers
     3. vscode **Merge Editor**: 3 windows will open
      - top left: incoming changes (theirs)
      - top right: current changes (yours)
      - bottom: result of merge (editable) - Also see "X conflicts"
      - after resolving, see **"0 conflict"**, click "complete merge" to stage the resolved files
